the diffrence between malloc and calloc 
maloc(n * sizeof(int)) => not insialized the memory
caloc(n , sizeof(int)) => insialized the memory by 0

realloc(NULL, n * sizeof(int)) == malloc
realloc(A, 0) == free(A)
realloc(A, (n/2) * sizeof(int)) == malloc
before A = 1 2 3 4 5
after  A = 1 2 the rest is a random addresses
