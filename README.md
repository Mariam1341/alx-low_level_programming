## About

- This repository consists of all the C programming projects done with [ALX Africa](https://www.alxafrica.com/) Full stack Software Engineering Programme in partnership with [Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.com/) by [Mariam1341](https://github.com/Mariam1341).
- All main.c files are prewritten by the school. We build functions that produce a specific output while also taking into consideration edge cases.
-I am learning about data structures, algorithms, and other low-level programming concepts while
working in the C language. I update this repo with my learning progresses with hands-on projects as listed below:

* [0x00. C - Hello, World](./0x00-hello_world)
* [0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while](./0x01-variables_if_else_while)
* [0x02. C - Functions, nested loops](./0x02-functions_nested_loops)
* [0x03. C - debugging](./0x03-debugging)
* [0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops](./0x04-more_functions_nested_loops)
* [0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings](./0x05-pointers_arrays_strings)
* [0x06. C - More pointers, arrays and strings](./0x06-pointers_arrays_strings)
* [0x07. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings](./0x07-pointers_arrays_strings)
* [0x08. C - Recursion](./0x08-recursion)
* [0x09. C - Static libraries](./0x09-static_libraries)
* [0x0A. C - argc, argv](./0x0A-argc_argv)
* [0x0B. C - malloc, free](./0x0B-malloc_free)
* [0x0C. C - More malloc, free](./0x0C-more_malloc_free)

- more projects are coming soon!!
- I am on my way to be the best software engineer that I  can possibly  be!
